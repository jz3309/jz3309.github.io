As for locations, different locations might have very different accidents profiles. But the more data we have, the more apparent the temporal patterns become. In the future, it might be worthy to try different spatial properties to identify clusters. Also, it will also be interesting to investigate how meaningful are the clusters regarding their explaining power.')
