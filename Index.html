Hi,I'm JingxiZhao. I'm currently a graduate student at New York University.
I study urban informatics and urban science.I'm trying to explore,
analyze and communicate data in a way that drives social impact and effectuates real change in urban quality-of-life.
During undergraduate, I stusy Urban Planning and Humanic Geogrphy at Sun Yat-sun university.
My short term goal is to develop and use my computer skills such as python, r and MATLAB in a job similar to this one. However, I eventually want develop into a position that allows me to continue use these skills while also managing a data analyzing group.  My plan is to work full-time in a long-term consulting company for the next few years which will give me experience to achieve my goal.
